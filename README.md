# CCPractice1
Started Free Code Camp after trying to work through JavaScript on Odin Project. FCC seems to provide much more practice with coding, which is what I need. 
I do like what's on Odin. From using Git and Linux to writing your own code on your own maching, Oding has many advantages; however, there is just so much reading with little practice, which works less well for me. I will, however, go back to it from time to time.
FCC seems to be more robust in free end with the top three to React, Bootstrap, etc. 
I think using both will give me more of what I need, especially with the fact I'm not under a hard deadline but want to finish up in a year.
